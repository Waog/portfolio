Write all source code in English, regardless of our chat language.

When you are in agent mode: don't explain things to me nor tell me what to do, unless I explicitly ask for advice or explanation. Instead, just finish implementing what I asked for; I want finished code and a working feature.

Before making high-level modifications like creating or modifying the public interface of a package, class, interface, or component, give me multiple suggestions/options for how the public interface of that class/component could look. Present them in a very brief numbered list, which only expects me to choose a number. Only present how the modified item will be consumed. Mark the recommended option as recommended.

Always implement things according to clean code practices, especially:

Apply the newspaper metaphor: top-level general functions, which call others, at the top of the file; low-level detailed helper functions, which are called, at the bottom of the file. I.e., no callee shall be above its caller in a file.

Avoid spaghetti code, pyramids of doom, and callback hells: Ensure that all statements within a function operate at the same level of abstraction‚Äîeither orchestrating high-level steps or performing low-level details, but not both. Instead of having deeply nested loops and if-statements in one code snippet, extract named helper methods.

Avoid comments: instead of writing comments describing your code blocks, extract methods with speaking names to wrap these code blocks. (Exception: Don't remove existing `TODO`, `FIXME`, etc. unless you fixed them. Don't remove concrete examples, e.g., input string and output of a regex. Don't remove information which can't be derived from viewing the code.)

prefer lombok: when applicable prefer lombok annotations over writing custom boilerplate code.

Assume existing code as best practice: Don't make up your own code style; instead, mimic existing code styles, unless you think existing code style is non-optimal.
Prefer placing import statements at the top of the file, rather than using inline imports, requires, or Fully Qualified Class Names.

## Commit Message Guidelines

All commit messages must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification, as enforced by commitlint and the commit message editor configuration. A valid commit message should have the following structure:

```
<type>[<scope>]: <emoji> <short description>

<body>

<footer>
```

- **type**: One of:

  - `fix`: A bug fix; triggers patch version bump and new release.
  - `feat`: A new feature; triggers minor version bump and new release.
  - `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
  - `chore`: Updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change
  - `ci`: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
  - `docs`: Documentation only changes
  - `perf`: A code change that improves performance
  - `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  - `revert`: Revert a previous commit
  - `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
  - `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

- **scope** (optional): One of:

  - `frontend`
  - `backend`
  - `infrastructure`
  - `docs`
  - `root`
  - `multiple`
    Use a scope to provide additional contextual information, e.g., `feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays`.

- **emoji**: One of:

  - `ü™≤` bugfix (`fix`)
  - `‚ôªÔ∏è` refactor (`refactor`)
  - `‚ú®` add feature (`feat`)
  - `üóëÔ∏è` remove feature
  - `üì¶` build process, CI/CD (`build`, `ci`)
  - `üöß` WIP - squash later
  - `üìÑ` Documentation (`docs`)

- **short description**: Brief summary of the change.

- **body** (optional): More detailed description.

- **footer** (optional): Additional information, such as:
  - `BREAKING CHANGE: ...` (triggers major version bump and new release.)
  - `NATIVE CHANGE` (if Expo OTA publish is insufficient and a new native build and app store release is required)

**When to use which type and emoji:**

- Use `feat` + `‚ú®` for new features.
- Use `fix` + `ü™≤` for bug fixes.
- Use `refactor` + `‚ôªÔ∏è` for code refactoring that does not add features or fix bugs.
- Use `docs` + `üìÑ` for documentation changes.
- Use `build` or `ci` + `üì¶` for build process or CI/CD changes.
- Use `chore` for maintenance tasks that do not affect production code.
- Use `test` for adding or correcting tests.
- Use `style` for formatting or stylistic changes.
- Use `revert` for reverting previous commits.
- Use `üóëÔ∏è` for removing features.
- Use `üöß` for work-in-progress commits that should be squashed later.

**Examples:**

```
feat(frontend): ‚ú® add user login page

Added a new login page with form validation.

BREAKING CHANGE: The authentication flow has changed.
```

```
fix(backend): ü™≤ handle null pointer in user service
```
